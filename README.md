## Overview

This project aims to replicate the well known game - *Piano Tiles*, where a series of tiles (depicted as rectangular boxes) fall with random patterns, and the user
controls a small tile at the base of the screen to *intercept* or *break* the tiles. A scoreboard is maintained at the top left corner of the screen which depicts the
number of tiles the user has intercepted since the game started. Once a tile is missed, the game ends, and the screen displays "GAME OVER !!", along with your last
score. Finally, to restart the game, a push button needs to be pressed.
